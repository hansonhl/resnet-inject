affinity propogation -- no need of embedding, similarity metric is enough
similarity-only clustering methods

how to calculate similarity metric

1. Error resilience property of BN
  - Get fp16 VGG network
  - Network A: with BN, Network B: without BN
  - Run a subset of images that the same results in networks and A and B
    Find such a subset

2. Drop based on distribution of weights
  - Drop out anything > (mean + 1*sigma) or (mean + 2*sigma)
    Do that on every layer of a healthy network if network has that

  - correctness not affected
  - Drop or clip? Drop.
